# Investigate a Dataset- Medical Appointments
The Dataset that the analyst have investigated comprises data from 100K medical appointments in Brazil.
The main question that this project has attempted to answer is: What are the factors that need to be considered in predicting if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?
In particular, the analyst has tried to find trends among the patients who showed up for their appointments, and how they differed from the patients who did not show up.
